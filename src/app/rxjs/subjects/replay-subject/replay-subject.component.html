    <p>ReplaySubject emits to any observer all of the items that were emitted by the source Observable(s), regardless of when the observer subscribes.</p>
    <p>The ReplaySubject is comparable to the BehaviorSubject in the way that it can send “old” values to new subscribers. It however has the extra characteristic that it can record a part of the observable execution and therefore store multiple old values and “replay” them to new subscribers.</p>
    <p>When creating the ReplaySubject you can specify how much values you want to store and for how long you want to store them. In other words you can specify: “I want to store the last 5 values, that have been executed in the last second prior to a new subscription”.</p>
